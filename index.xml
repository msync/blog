      <title>The Fallacy of the Full-stackist</title>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s not easy to know everything.
And the previous statement easily counts as one of the best understatements that can ever be made. But, it&amp;#39;s not a lie. Even if it does not convey the truth very well. But, we&amp;#39;re in the age of super-hyper competition, misinformation, and #kill-your-cognitive-abilities-with-information-overload. So, the above just works fine without being called out for lying.
10x Idiot? Of course, as we are not incorrect, let&amp;#39;s take it further.</description>

      <title>Useful Clojure Asides - Logging and Exceptions</title>
      <link>https://msync.org/posts/2015/2015-06-08-clojure-useful-asides/</link>

      <description>Logging and exception handling are such core requirements in any application which are rarely, if ever, discussed. At least in the initial phases of any application. But as any developer would vouch (when asked, not voluntarily, I think), logging right is a very crucial aspect of any application. Not only does it help you understand the (then-) current state of the application, they also help folks trace causes of various problems when done right.</description>

      <description>The Clojure language primarily targets the Java Virtual Machine, and so obviously, we have a topic.

      <title>Developing Chrome Extensions using Clojurescript</title>
      <link>https://msync.org/posts/2015/2015-04-05-chrome-extensions-and-clojurescript/</link>

      <description>TL;DR - Of course, you can use Clojurescript to develop Chrome Extensions. So, that&amp;#39;s not the topic of this post. I&amp;#39;ve only documented how you&amp;#39;d set up your project, using the latest versions (as of this post&amp;#39;s publishing) of piggieback and weasel.
Why Weasel? Because, as its author explains
A WebSocket transport is simple and avoids some of the thornier bugs caused by the CrossPageChannel transport, which is used in the standard ClojureScript browser REPL and Austin.</description>

      <title>On The &#39;Decay&#39; Of Small Organizations into Large Organizations</title>
      <link>https://msync.org/posts/2015/2015-04-01-large-and-small-organizations/</link>

      <description>Size is just a number. Unless you stop using a number and qualify with adjectives like large and small. Implicitly, when speaking of companies/organizations, we somehow associate young and old with small and large respectively. We associate the term start up with a young and small company. But more accurately. there&amp;#39;s a sub-conscious association of various characteristics with such a company - agile, ad hoc, tech-savvy, dynamic and lively, top-notch folks.</description>

      <description>Matters of the mind matter. As time flies, or crawls, or stops, and as water flows (or doesn’t) under some zillion bridges, I (d)evolve until I don’t. But being the megalomaniac that I am, the world needs to know how I have been living, thinking, existing, and degenerating. So, in this randomly chosen (lucky) year, I’ve decided to blog again. A few unlucky years passed by, but we’ll let that pass.</description>
