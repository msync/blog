# Synopsis

Notes and pointers during the exploration of the book [LLM From Scratch](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) by [Sebastian Raschka](https://github.com/rasbt). While I am using this book as the central reference, the notes will contain additional references and pointers to other resources.
