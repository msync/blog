<p>It&#39;s not easy to know everything.</p>

<p>
And the previous statement easily counts as one of the best understatements that can ever be made. But, it&#39;s not a lie. Even if it does not convey the truth very well. But, we&#39;re in the age of super-hyper competition, misinformation, and <em>#kill-your-cognitive-abilities-with-information-overload</em>. So, the above just works fine without being called out for lying.</p>

10x Idiot?
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Of course, as we are not incorrect, let&#39;s take it further. <code class="verbatim">10 times 0 is zero.</code> Or, 10 times a very small number is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">still quite small</span>. We can now claim the existence of <strong>10x</strong> engineers without lying, by simply leaving the value of <strong>x</strong> unspecified. The bar is low, so we can <del>jump</del> gloss over it.</p>

The Full Stack Developer –  Perception and Reality Mismatch
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
<p>That&#39;s sufficient background to build to come to the point - the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">full-stack</span> developer. I&#39;ll go out on a limb and claim that <code class="verbatim">it&#39;s just another term for a generalist, but with the perception of much different expectations</code>.</p>
<p>
The traditional definition of a generalist implies someone who has a coherent handle on the big picture and can work on the 80% portions (of the <em>80-20</em> fame). And they might be an expert in a couple of things too.</p>
<p>
The implicit powers projected on a <em>full-stack developer</em> include not just complex backend flows, bazillion UI skillsets and <em>DevOps</em>. But other unspecified abilities that can be invoked any time by the managers via a magic-wand when short of manpower and time. Especially on the back of a critical, urgent business need that sprung up as an imaginary user need in the mind of a product guy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-3">
The Harm
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>I don&#39;t have anything against the term. It&#39;s only about the way I&#39;ve seen it being applied in highly inappropriate ways by people in positions of influence and power. With the wrong perceptions, the expectations are wildly off.</p>
<p>
It takes quite some time to become a generalist. A generalist grows by way of varied experiences over time, gaining depths in a few areas along the journey by way of managing to find – either by proactive pursuit, or incidentally – complex problems, and mostly successfully also solving them. Expertise and experience are very nuanced things.</p>
<p>
The <em>rebadging</em> of generalists to full-stackists harms the generalists who now feel burdened to appear experts in more areas than they can manage. And the harmful expectations from management on being multi-skilled <em>with depth</em> – <em>aka</em> full-stack development skills – cause a lot of stress to developers struggling to blend into the new fad for fear of being marked as an underachiever.</p>
<p>
But it <strong>is</strong> happening. The under-pressure ex-backend-now-full-stack-developer is now churning out stackoverflow-inspired Angular applications, and the ex-frontend-now-full-stack-developer is now creating controllers with a bazillion annotations without an iota of idea of the underlying mechanics of the new systems they are working on.</p>
<div class="verse-block">
<p>You can&#39;t rush experience.</p>
</div>
<p>
<code class="verbatim">Experience is not only the actual time spent gaining it - it is also the time spent afterwards where your brain gets to mull over it and assimilate your efforts with your larger self-existence.</code> Please slow down. Be realistic. The technology world is now way more complex than it was in the last decade, and it&#39;s only going further that way. We keep finding ways to scale machines and make them efficient – nicely captured in the likes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore&#39;s law</a>. But the human development scale is way more spread out and it&#39;s unlikely to be anywhere close to matching the machines. Yet.</p>
