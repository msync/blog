Size is just a number. Unless you stop using a number and qualify with adjectives like large and small.
Implicitly, when speaking of companies/organizations, we somehow associate young and old with small
and large respectively. We associate the term <em>start up</em> with a young <em>and</em> small company. But more accurately.
there&#39;s a sub-conscious association of various characteristics with such a company - agile, <em>ad hoc</em>,
tech-savvy, dynamic and lively, top-notch folks. These are considered a given. And we somehow
marvel large companies who display even a fraction of these characteristics. Because we don&#39;t expect
elephants to dance.</p>
<p>
So, when does a start-up <em>stop</em> being a start-up? When does a company become large? That&#39;s a tough question to
answer, so we might as well try to find out the reasons why and when does a company become overcome with
inertia, processes, tech-advancement averse thinking. Don&#39;t get me wrong, but all these problems on the
surface appear to be related to the <em>leadership</em>. And no, I do not think it is about <em>bad</em> leadership, but
more about bad-fit leaders.</p>
<p>
A leader who does not either understand what her subordinates do or is too overwhelmed by the size of the
(sub-)organization she is leading may be forced to hire more of direct subordinates to help her overcome
the situation. And she <em>should!</em> But irrespective of whether the subordinate is an employee or a consultant,
quality matters. &#34;Of course!&#34;, you say. But here&#39;s the problem. The organization is looking to hire an expert
or experts for a problem they possibly themselves do not understand well. So, how in the first place do you
judge quality?</p>
<p>
Enter the much cliched jargon - <em>processes</em>, <em>metrics</em>, <em>industry-standards</em>, and what not. Unfortunately,
these are but buzzwords, distilled from years of experience through failing and succeeding by some really
good souls. But buzzwords are exactly those because people who may have had no experience personally
applying and failing and/or succeeding surface as relative experts. So, if you found the wrong people
to help you overcome your situation, you end up putting the entire organization&#39;s operations in a jeopardy.
And if this continues for a long time, you have some bad news…</p>
<p>
So, what&#39;s the way out? I don&#39;t know an absolute answer, but to me it appears to be a case of delaying finding
a solution until you really feel the pain and then finding a quick-fix. So, it would not be out of place
to suggest that you need to look for the right people to join you <strong>much</strong> earlier, as much as you are
willing to fire the wrong ones as soon as you realize that they are the wrong ones. It might feel like
a non-optimal step when you actually hire someone in advance, but a very likely globally optimal step.</p>
<p>
There&#39;s another distinction to watch out for. As a leader, you need to distinguish between being
overwhelmed due to lack of time <em>versus</em> being overwhelmed due to a lack of understanding of the <em>whys</em> 
of the problem. And this may be another discussion.</p>
<p>
The above is a build-up to make a case for quoting the following, well-known hiring principle.
 <code class="verbatim">Always hire someone smarter than yourself</code>. And then qualifying that further with - <code class="verbatim">Much earlier!</code></p>
<p>
On a small scale (like, in a start up), the effects of hiring B-grade people are more drastic and immediate,
and the system pushes back quickly for course-correction. As the company grows, the B-hires and C-hires
are absorbed much more easily, as the process of hiring and firing is a lot more cumbersome and far-removed
from the leaders in most cases. The decay then gradually spreads.</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not without reason that some of the best known and sought-after <strong>large</strong> companies like Google and
Facebook are so hard to get into. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Right?</span></p>
<p>
In some future posts, I&#39;ll attempt to put forth some more thoughts on the decay problem from both a
human resources perspective, and from a technology adoption/upgrade perspective.</p>
